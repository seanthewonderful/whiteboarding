Python programmers write variable names in snake case, where each word is lowercase and joined by underscores. For example, if you were to write “very hungry caterpillar” in snake case, you’d write very_hungry_caterpillar.

JavaScript programmers write variable names in camel case, where the initial word is lowercase and other words are capitalized. For example, if you were to write “very hungry caterpillar” in camel case you’d write veryHungryCaterpillar.

Write a function that converts a string in snake case to a string in camel case.

Write a function that takes in a phrase and returns a dictionary that can be used to lookup words by word lengths.

For example, the phrase "cute cats chase funny rats" should return a dictionary like so:

    5: {"chase", "funny"}
}
Notice that the keys of the dictionary above are integers and its values are sets that contain strings.

For example, the first letter goes in the first row, the second letter goes in the second row, the third letter goes in the first row, and so on…
